# Random Nickname and Avatar

---
### What is it?

This is simple command line app that generates nicknames and chooses avatar for you. 

### How does it work? 
It Chooses 3 random words (color, some adjective and noun) from 3 separate files and glues them together. Also chooses random file from avatar directory. Then it prints whatever it came up with: 

    Nick: SalmonGuilelessHen | Avatar: av (3).jpg
  
Smaple output ^

### Why? 

Im too lazy to think nicknames up and search for appropriate avatar, so I wrote this. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

It's also a privacy thing; I never use the same nickname twice, just like password, so it's harder to find my other accounts on the web. 
This thing... yeah, I know it ain't much but it's honest work. I have few ideas on how to improve it, so maybe I'll update it somewhere in the future.
Cheers.
